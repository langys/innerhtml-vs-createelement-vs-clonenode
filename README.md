# innerHTML vs. createElement vs. cloneNode

Me today on Twitter (https://twitter.com/soprano/status/657010434004897792):

> Today's discovery: Every DOM access in IE11 (or Edge) seemingly takes 0.01ms. Chrome, Firefox, Safari all 10x faster (less than 0.001ms ea).

---

The scripts in this repo are how I tested. We create a simple DOM hierarchy with 9 nodes and a few attributes each. The hierarchy looks like this:

```
<li data-reactid="22" class="clearfix sideNavItem stat_elem" id="navItem_217974574879787">
  <div data-reactid="23" class="buttonWrap" data-testid="bookmark_edit_button">
    <div data-reactid="24" class="uiSideNavEditButton">
      <a data-reactid="25" href="#" title="Edit Messages link" aria-label="Edit Messages link" class="_1wc5 _26tg accessible_elem"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <a data-reactid="26" data-testid="left_nav_item_Messages" class="_5afe sortableItem" data-gt="{&quot;bmid&quot;:&quot;217974574879787&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;bookmark_type&quot;:&quot;type_facebook_app&quot;,&quot;rank&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;nav_items_count&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;nav_section&quot;:&quot;favorites&quot;,&quot;sec_position&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;screen_height&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;screen_width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;total&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;masher&quot;:&quot;item&quot;}" title="Messages" href="/messages/" draggable="true">
    <span data-reactid="27" class="imgWrap" data-testid="bookmark_icon_left_nav">
      <i data-reactid="28" height="16" width="16" draggable="true" class="img sp_YH4CuyEceFD sx_1045ce"></i>
    </span>
    <div data-reactid="29" class="linkWrap noCount">
      <span data-reactid="30" class="">Messages</span>
    </div>
  </a>
</li>
```

This structure is based off of the left navigation bookmarks on the Facebook site when you're logged in. In this repo I'm testing just setting an `.innerHTML` string, calling `.createElement` and `.setAttribute`, and -- since this test case is inspired by a list where much of node structure is the same for each item -- calling `.cloneNode(true)` then setting the attributes that differ across each item.

**Update:** It looks like in Edge and IE, passing a tree with *n* nodes to `.appendChild` takes *O(n)* time, so there is a huge gain from appending each node before it has children. I've added a new case (testCreate2) to demo this.

See bench.js for the exact code I'm testing.

To run the tests, start up an HTTP server in this directory, then visit:

* http://127.0.0.1:8080/runner.html?testFn=testHTML
* http://127.0.0.1:8080/runner.html?testFn=testCreate
* http://127.0.0.1:8080/runner.html?testFn=testCreate2
* http://127.0.0.1:8080/runner.html?testFn=testClone

It should run 40 trials (each trial creates this hierarchy 1000 times) and give you the mean time (in ms), along with a confidence interval for that mean. Each trial is run in a new iframe, so any JIT warmup time should be counted in the numbers.

You can also visit `bench.html?testFn=testHTML` directly to run one trial.

## Results

All numbers in ms, lower numbers are better.

## Conclusion

It seems like Edge and IE 11 are on the order of 10x to 20x slower than Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The slowness of the `document.createElement` alternative is particularly frustrating because (presumably) the browser needs to perform almost the same operations when parsing the HTML, but executing them from JavaScript takes a huge performance hit.

**Update:** Inserting each node before it has any children (testCreate2) is much, much faster in Edge and IE (and barely slower in Chrome, neutral in Firefox and Safari). In Edge, the `.createElement` version is now faster than `.innerHTML`. In IE11, `.createElement` is now a 20% performance hit instead of the 80% slowdown I originally saw.

Using `.cloneNode`, we can recoup most of the losses in Edge/IE, but we still see that each DOM access has a considerable cost: if you modify `testCreate()` or `testClone()` to comment out individual DOM accesses, you'll find that each dom access has a cost of around 0.01 ms, which adds up quickly.

Did I miss something? Was this test unfair somehow? Do you know of a way to make these test cases run faster? Please open an issue or contact me directly if so!
